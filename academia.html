                            Both studies focused on young university students. Study A sampled 197 undergraduate students at the University of South Florida, St. Petersburg campus. Study B collected 926 datasets from a German university, of which 132 were studied. The average age

                        <p>Study A was available online in December 2014, and Study B was published in May 2013. While I did find more recent studies surrounding the subject, comparing surveys that are too far apart is difficult, especially due to the pace
                            at which streaming services have grown over the past decade. I decided to stick with studies that both discussed the streaming landscape during similar time-periods. </p>

            <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="600">The effect of music streaming services on music piracy among college students.</h2>
            <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="600">Borja, Dieringer, and Daw propose the following hypotheses regarding the effect of streaming services on piracy among students:
                <ol data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="600">
                    <li>Age, gender, and income affect the likelihood of engaging in music piracy.</li>
                    <li>Peer pressure and herding behaviour affect the likelihood of engaging in music piracy.</li>
                    <li>Perceived risks and penalties associated with music piracy affects the likelihood of engaging in music piracy.</li>
                    <li>Individuals’ opinions about the music industry or the artists affect the likelihood of engaging in music piracy.</li>
                    <li>Music streaming affects the likelihood of engaging in music piracy.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="600">Results show that students tend to engage in music piracy if they believe that “everybody else is doing it” or “there is nothing wrong with doing it.” Also, the perception of low risk and limited punishment increases digital music crime. Additionally,
                beliefs about the artist’s achievements influence students to engage in music piracy as well. Most notably, the study states that the results indicate that music streaming increases the likelihood of engaging in music piracy by about 20%.

        <div id="sec5">
            <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="600">Music as a Service (MaaS) as an alternative to piracy?</h2>
            <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="600">Dörr, Wagner, Hess, and Benlian propose hypotheses based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour, which assumes that the attitude towards an object affects behaviour related to that object, which in this case, is music streaming. They form eight
                hypotheses to understand attitudes towards streaming services and intention to use them:</p>
            <ol data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="600">
                <li>Attitude Towards streaming services is positively related to intention to use streaming services.</li>
                <li>Subjective Norm (belief about important people's attitudes towards streaming services) is positively related to intention to use streaming services.</li>
                <li>Perceived Behavioural Control (difficulty in using streaming services) is positively related to intention to use streaming services.</li>
                <li>Submission of Music Recommendations is positively related to attitude towards streaming services.</li>
                <li>Search for Music Recommendations is positively related to attitude towards streaming services.</li>
                <li>Desire to own music is negatively related to attitude towards streaming services.</li>
                <li>Flat Rate Preference (usage-independent subscription fee) is positively related to attitude towards streaming services.</li>
                <li>Relative advantage of streaming services compared to illegal channels (generally better sound-quality, lower search costs, legality) is positively related to attitude towards streaming services.</li>
            </ol>
            <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="600">The study focused on the datasets that involved subjects who had engaged in piracy in the last month. Results varied for free and paid streaming services. Perceived Behavioural Control did not have a large effect on those that intended to
                use paid services, but it did on those that intended on using free streaming services. Attitude towards the services, as well as subjective norm, had a large role to play in intention to use these services. They note that strong attitudes
                towards streaming services do not necessarily lead to a willingness to pay, but rather, intention to test the free model. Music recommendations, easier searchability, and most importantly, the relative advantages of streaming services
                over illegal downloading, all positively influenced attitudes towards streaming services. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="sec6">
            <p data-aos="fade" data-aos-duration="2000">
                The important consideration here is that both studies note a positive correlation in between a person's use of (or intention to use) streaming services and the likelihood to pirate music, but both studies interpret this correlation differently. Study
                B suggests that because pirates have a positive attitude towards streaming services, it offers a viable alternative to them, possibly stopping them from engaging in piracy in the future. However, Study A approaches this correlation with
                a more negative outlook, declaring in the introduction that music streamers are young computer users who might feel at ease downloading music illegally, and confirming that declaration with the results. While Study A suggests the influence
                of streaming services on the intention to engage in piracy, Study B discusses the possibility that streaming services offer an alternative to pirates.</p>
