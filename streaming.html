                As Napster declined, Apple was more than happy to take its place. They struck deals with record labels and monetized the downloading of music, which they had realized at this point, people would do regardless of whether it was legal or
                not. Although iTunes was not the only digital download store, it was the largest one, and in 2008, it became the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2008/04/03iTunes-Store-Top-Music-Retailer-in-the-US/">largest music retailer in the United States.</a></p>

            <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="600">The digital revolution enabled consumers with convenient ways to download and listen to music, and iTunes (among others) helped monetize that convenience. Smartphones and the iPod also played a massive role in allowing listeners to carry their
                music around with them. These novel conveniences were the foundation for the rise of streaming services. Users wanted to listen to whatever music they wanted, whenever and wherever they wanted it, and one of the first examples of a service
                that allowed them to do so was Pandora. Launched in 2005, the service adopted a freemium model, which allowed users to listen to multiple online radio channels for free with advertisements, or pay a small fee to listen to them ad-free.
                In a sense, Pandora was one of the pioneers of the music streaming concept, even though initially, their service revolved around online radio rather than on-demand catalogue access.</p>

                    <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="600"> Eventually, other entrepreneurs began to understand the potential of such a service and other streaming services soon began to pop up. Rather than online radio, these services offered immediate access to massive catalogues of music,
                        essentially allowing users to listen to whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted. Perhaps the most prominent example of such a service is Spotify. Launched in 2008, they garnered an immense catalogue by striking deals with major
                        record labels. They operate on a freemium model, and their business model involves revenue through advertisements and subscription-payments. Much of their revenue is paid out in the form of royalties to artists on the platform.
                        Spotify is still one of the largest streaming services today, but multiple other streaming services have since popped up. These include services such as Apple Music, Tidal, Prime Music, and YouTube Music, among others.

                Streaming services have been criticised heavily, largely for not paying artists enough in royalties. Artists such as Thom Yorke of Radiohead and Taylor Swift have withdrawn their music from Spotify in the past (although most of their music is now available
                again), and the criticism received by Spotify is generally applicable across most streaming services. Conversely, some artists such as <a href="https://ew.com/article/2015/04/15/record-store-day-preview-return-cassette/"
                    target="_blank">Dave Grohl</a> and <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1221639/Shakira-hits-Lily-Allen-illegal-downloading-row-claims-file-sharing-brings-closer-fans.html" target="_blank">Shakira</a> have defended piracy,
                talking about how the affordability of music should not be an obstacle for listeners. Additionally, some studies have shown that some amount of piracy can, in fact,
                <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/just-enough-piracy-can-be-a-good-thing/" target="_blank">help manufacturers, retailers, and consumers</a>. While we assume, for the purpose of this website, that streaming services are preferable
                to music piracy, there is an argument to be made for the other side as well.
