Combine that with the MP3 format's small file size, and you get a culture of easy and boundless music piracy. Companies tried and tried again to lock CDs and
                    prevent music from being copied, but they were no match for pirates. One of the largest mediums through which music was pirated was Napster. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2009/12/21/121690908/napster-the-file-sharing-service-that-started-it-all"
                        target="_blank">Napster allowed users to easily share and search for MP3 files</a>, and this massively disrupted the music industry, which largely failed to respond for a long time.</p>

                The company was sued by multiple artists such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/13/8399099/metallica-sued-napster-15-years-ago-today" target="_blank">Metallica</a> and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/metallica-napster-settle-236089/"

                later acquired by the music streaming service, Rhapsody, which has now <a href="https://help.napster.com/hc/en-us/articles/222763108-Rhapsody-is-Now-Napster" target="_blank">rebranded itself as the company that it bought</a>. Maybe this
                speaks to the fact that despite the illegal nature of the website, people loved the website and many still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/14/11936974/rhapsody-rebrands-as-napster" target="_blank">remember it fondly</a>.

            <p data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-duration="800">There are contrasting views as to whether piracy has become more, or less popular in recent years, which makes it difficult to directly correlate the rising success of streaming services with trends in piracy. While some reports suggest that
                piracy has <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2019/09/25/music-piracy-plunging/" target="_blank">gone down</a> tremendously in terms of the percentage of people that stream or download unlicensed music, others discuss the rise of

                on streaming sites. To understand the relationship between piracy and streaming, a few underlying questions need to be answered.

                    <h2 class="questionH">What exactly counts as piracy?</h2>
                    <p class="questionP">While the answer is pretty clear in some cases, there is a grey area to consider. If downloading songs from YouTube is piracy, is it also piracy to watch videos on YouTube with an adblocker? If a streaming service offers a free trial,
                        is it piracy to keep registering for free trials with different e-mail IDs and never pay for the service? Is it piracy to use a personal subscription to a streaming service and then stream the music in a public place?</p>

                    <h2 class="questionH">Should the numbers be defined in terms of how many files/songs were downloaded, or by the number of pirates?</h2>
                    <p class="questionP">Although it is hard to find global data on the distribution of the number of songs downloaded by individual users, it is a reasonable assumption that consumption patterns vary, and that some people pirate music routinely while others
                        do it only occasionally.</p>

                    <p class="questionP">Even if the quantity of files downloaded/number of pirates may go up in a given year, it could simply reflect growth in music consumption, and other consumption methods may also have grown by proportionally larger amounts in the same
                        year. Piracy's popularity as a method of consumption may hence have decreased when analyzed in context.</p>
