# Streaming-And-Piracy-Website

This is a website I made for my Multimedia Analysis and Design Course at the University of Glasgow. It discusses the rise of music streaming services and the relevant effects on music piracy. I decided to host the website to include it in my portfolio :)

Note that this was designed to be viewed on a desktop, and is not mobile-compatible (I have learned to design mobile-first, but this was assessed on a desktop and was designed accordlingly). 

This is a static website. I used CSS for most of the styling, JS for some other design elements (the rotating CD on the homepage, for example) and a few other tools (the AOS Library, for example) 

I received an A2 (21/22) for this project, and an A3 in total (project + report). I've attached the Feedback here:
